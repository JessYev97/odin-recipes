<h1> This is my first Website </h1>

<p> This project has been very useful in that it helped me apply everything I have been learning through The Odin Project. My commits will show it took a few tries to understand and implement some of the concepts. By working through the project I was able to solidify my understanding of how to do the following: </p>

<ul>
<li> link html files </li>
<li> link images to html files from the web </li>
<li> create ordered and unordered lists within my files </li>
<li> size headings </li>
<li> write paragraphs </li>
<li> stage and commit my changes in code </li>
<li> view my commit log </li>
</ul>
