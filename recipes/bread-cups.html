    <h1> Homemade Bread Cups for Soup </h1>

    <p> The author of this recipe is Heather Tullos. This recipe takes 30 minutes to prep
        and 25 minutes to cook. It will serve four bread cups. In the marjins of this recipe 
        my mom has written "Jess: this is that recipe you and I made together at the farm, maybe Jan 2018?". 
        I love her personal writings throughout the cook book.

    <ul> 
        <li> one tablespoon active dry yeast</li>
        <li> one tablespoon light brown sugar</li>
        <li> one and a fourth cups of warm water</li>
        <li> three cups of all purpose flour</li>
        <li> two tablespoons of olive oil</li>
        <li> one tablespoon of kosher salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2> Instructions </h2>
    
    <ol> 
        <li> Preheat the oven to 400 degrese F. Spray a baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray or line with parchment paper. </li> 
        <li> In a large bowl stir together the yeast, brown sugar, and warm water. Let it sit for about five minutes. This allows the yeast to bloom. </li>
        <li> Stir in the flour, olive oil, and three fourths teaspoon of the salt until the dough just comes together. Lift it from the bowl and form a ball.</li>
        <li> Place the ball back in the bowl then on top of the preheating oven and cover with towel. Leave for 25 minutes.</li> 
        <li> dust work surface with flour. Knead dough three to four times. Divide into four equal pieces and shape each piece into a ball. </li>
        <li> Brush each with olive oil. Sprinkle with salt. Using a sharp knife slash an 'X' on top of each ball.</li>
        <li> Move to baking sheet and bake for 25 to 30 minutes. They should sound hollow when tapped.</li>
    </ol>
